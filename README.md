# AlexNet
This is an implement of AlexNet base on [kratzert's work](https://github.com/kratzert/finetune_alexnet_with_tensorflow).
It can apply to others classification tasks through modifying the last fully-connected layer. In the same time, you can choose the network's layer you want to train. The pre-trained weights of AlexNet is at <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~guerzhoy/tf_alexnet/> and another dataset can be found at <https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Drhq1Xrs5zTju690DHvf_Q> whose extraction code is "lvhc". You need to pull them under the home directory when you need to utilize them.
